{"name":"Htop","tagline":"Mirror of https://htop.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/htop","body":"\r\nhtop\r\nby Hisham Muhammad <loderunner@users.sourceforge.net>\r\n\r\nMay, 2004 - December, 2010\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThis is htop, an interactive process viewer.\r\nIt requires ncurses. It is tested with Linux 2.6,\r\nbut is also reported to work (and was originally developed)\r\nwith the 2.4 series.\r\n\r\nNote that, while, htop is Linux specific -- it is based\r\non the Linux /proc filesystem -- it is also reported to work\r\nwith FreeBSD systems featuring a Linux-compatible /proc.\r\nThis is, however, unsupported. Contact the packager for your\r\nsystem when reporting problems on platforms other than Linux.\r\n\r\nThis software has evolved considerably during the last years,\r\nand is reasonably complete, but there is still room for\r\nimprovement. Read the TODO file to see what's known to be missing.\r\n\r\nComparison between 'htop' and 'top'\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n * In 'htop' you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally\r\n   to see all processes and full command lines.\r\n * In 'top' you are subject to a delay for each unassigned\r\n   key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape\r\n   sequences are triggered by accident).\r\n * 'htop' starts faster ('top' seems to collect data for a while\r\n   before displaying anything).\r\n * In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number to\r\n   kill a process, in 'top' you do.\r\n * In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number or\r\n   the priority value to renice a process, in 'top' you do.\r\n * In 'htop' you can kill multiple processes at once.\r\n * 'top' is older, hence, more tested.\r\n\r\nCompilation instructions\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.\r\nSee the INSTALL file for detailed instructions, but you are\r\nprobably used to the common \"configure/make/make install\" routine.\r\n\r\nSee the manual page (man htop) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'\r\ninside htop) for a list of supported key commands.\r\n\r\nif not all keys work check your curses configuration.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
